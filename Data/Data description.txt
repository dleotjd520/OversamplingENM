# Title: 
Occurrence Patterns of Five Benthic Macroinvertebrate Species in Freshwater Ecosystems of South Korea

# Description
Using nationwide datasets from the Biological Monitoring Network and Water Quality Monitoring Network collected between 2011 and 2021, we constructed a database on the occurrence and habitat environments of five widely distributed benthic macroinvertebrate species: Baetis fuscatus, Limnodrilus gotoi, Hydropsyche kozhantschikovi, Teloganopsis punctisetae, and Ephemera orientalis. The original monitoring data were obtained from the Water Environment Information System (http://water.nier.go.kr). Monitoring sites within the same river system and located within 500 m of each other were linked based on geographic coordinates. Each dataset contains information on the presence or absence (1/0) of the five target species and eight physicochemical variables: pH, conductivity (ÂµS/cm), dissolved oxygen (DO; mg/L), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD; mg/L), chemical oxygen demand (COD; mg/L), total suspended solids (SS; mg/L), total nitrogen (TN; mg/L), and total phosphorus (TP; mg/L). Among the attached files, D1 provides the raw data, and D2 contains preprocessed data with outliers removed and environmental filtering applied.
