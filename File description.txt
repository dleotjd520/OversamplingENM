The folder contains example R scripts developed and modified by the author for the present study, along with the corresponding sample data files.
Descriptions of each R script (C1–C5, format: .R) and sample data file (formats: .CSV and .RData) are provided below.

# (R) C2. Oversampling function
- Sampling With Replacement (SWR), SMOTE, BLSMOTE, ADASYN and DBSMOTE are available for use.

# (R) C3. Statistical analysis function
- Data arrangement function for statistical test (Common function)

- Used in codes C3 and C4

# (RData) Sample data.C5_ENM result_Max
- Output generated through code C4
- Contains data used for ENM development, the developed ENM, evaluation results, and parameter settings
- Maximum entropy model applied (i.e., Max)
- Used in code C5

# (CSV) Sample data.C5_sp1_0.20_Max
- Results of variable importance analysis using ENM
- Includes ENMs without oversampling, and with SMOTE and ADASYN applied
- Contains variable importance values from five repeated ENM runs (i.e., k1–k5)
- Used in section 5.2. 'Variable importance-based distance between models' in C5
