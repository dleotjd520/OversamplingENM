This document contains the R sample scripts and example files created and modified by the author for this study. Since variable selection during the preprocessing step and the construction of ENMs were performed using functions provided by R packages, the code provided here focuses on the remaining processes. A description of each code sample is provided below.

# R1. Preprocessing function
-1.1. Outlier detection using Hampel filter
-1.2. Environmentally filter 
-1.3. Data partition

# R2. Statistical analysis function
-3.1. Permutation test
-3.2. Multi-Response Permutation Procedure (MRPP)

# R3. Sensitivity analysis
-Variable importance-based distance between models
